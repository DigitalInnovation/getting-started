# Welcome to Digital Innovation at Marks and Spencer

## Introduction

This is the official **GitHub** location for 
**[Marks and Spencer](http://www.marksandspencer.com)**, London UK.



## Getting Access

If you would like access to the private repositories that we have on GitHub then you need a sponsor (team leader/manager) to invite you into the organisation. The sponsor must be an existing member who will validate and takes full responsibility for you joining. The sponsor needs to add you into the `DigitalInnovation/People/Users.txt` file and create a branch with the request in. All requests are validated and those approved will get an invite email sent to them.

Please make sure you have accurate profile information on your account first, to pass some of the validation checks...


## Maintaining accurate Profile Information

To remain a member of the organisation, you must maintain your [Profile Information](https://github.com/settings/profile) - this need to be accurate and complete. This includes ensuring the **Name** and **Company** fields are both filled in and contrain correct information; and ideally having a photo of yourself on the profile too.

Members who do not have complete profile information will be removed from the Organisation automatically and only restored when the profile is correctly maintained.


## Public and Private repositories

Most of our repositories are private and only accessible to members of the organisation. If you create a new repo please make sure it starts off **private** and you get all the correct approvals before changing it to **public**.

 
## Getting help

The best place to ask for help is on [**Slack**](https://teamawesome.slack.com/), and channel `#github`.
